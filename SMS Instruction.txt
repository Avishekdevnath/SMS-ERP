🧩 Folder Structure in Next.js 15.3.3
With the introduction of the App Router in Next.js 15.3.3, organizing your project structure is crucial for maintainability and scalability. Here's a suggested folder structure:
app/
├── layout.tsx                # Root layout component
├── page.tsx                  # Home page component
├── login/
│   └── page.tsx              # Login page component
├── dashboard/
│   ├── layout.tsx            # Dashboard layout
│   ├── admin/
│   │   └── page.tsx          # Admin dashboard page
│   ├── developer/
│   │   └── page.tsx          # Developer dashboard page
│   ├── manager/
│   │   └── page.tsx          # Manager dashboard page
│   ├── sre/
│   │   └── page.tsx          # SRE dashboard page
│   ├── mentor/
│   │   └── page.tsx          # Mentor dashboard page
│   └── student/
│       └── page.tsx          # Student dashboard page
├── settings/
│   └── page.tsx              # Settings page
└── error/
    └── page.tsx              # Error handling page


This structure leverages the App Router's capabilities, ensuring a clean and scalable organization of components and pages.

🔐 Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
To manage the diverse user roles effectively, implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is essential. Here's how you can approach it:
                                                                                                                                                                                          * Define Roles and Permissions: Clearly outline what each role can access and perform within the application.

                                                                                                                                                                                          * Assign Roles to Users: Ensure that each user is assigned a role that aligns with their responsibilities.

                                                                                                                                                                                          * Enforce Access Control: Utilize middleware or higher-order components to restrict access to pages and components based on the user's role.

This approach ensures that users have access only to the resources and functionalities pertinent to their roles, enhancing security and user experience.

❌ Avoid (for now)
Feature
	Reason
	💬 Real-Time Chat
	Hard to moderate and scale. Ticket system is better for now.
	🛠️ Complex Scheduling System
	Use simple booking/calendar-style interface initially.

🔑 Why Lite Logs Shifted to V2
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Auditability is critical: It deters misuse and supports transparency without needing complete audit trails v1.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Compliance readiness: Helps prepare for regulatory needs like SOC2 through basic monitoring and accountability (coreview.com, youtube.com, reddit.com, stackoverflow.com, pangea.cloud, auditboard.com, zengrc.com).
